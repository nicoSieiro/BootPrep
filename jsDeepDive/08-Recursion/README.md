###Overview

In the Recursion test spec we will practice writing recursive functions.  The idea behind recursion is that a function calls itself until it reaches a condition, known as the base case. Recursion is very useful when you want to break a large complex problem into multiple, smaller problems. Additionally, recursion can help you think in a more Functional Programming context. 

In the lecture videos we will review recursion, how to determine your base case, and the call stack.
